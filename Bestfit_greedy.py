#__________space complexity___________
# - The sorted_files list requires O(n) space where n is the number of files.
# - The folders list holds tuples of (remaining_capacity, files) for each folder.
#   In the worst case, this list can hold n folders, so the space complexity is O(n).
# - The heap used for managing the folders requires O(n) space because there could be up to n folders in the worst case.
# - Therefore, the total space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of files.
